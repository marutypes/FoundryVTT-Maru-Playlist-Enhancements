# Maru's Playlist Enhancements

This FoundryVTT module adds some enhancements to Foundry's playlist UI.

- Adds a "Play Exclusively" button to playlists in the playlist directory. When clicked, the selected playlist will play, and all other playlists will stop.
- Adds a "Stop All" button to the Currently Playing drawer which, which stops all playing sounds when clicked. Allows you to easily clear up leftover sounds from a previous scene or whatever.
