# Play Exclusively

This FoundryVTT module adds some enhancements to Foundry's playlists:

- Adds a "Play Exclusively" button to playlists in the playlist directory. When clicked, the selected playlist will play, and all other playlists will stop.
- Adds a "Stop All" button to the Currently Playing drawer, allowing you to easily clear up leftover sounds from a previous scene
